# Intro

## Understanding ##
Kasparov: Every new generation has a better understanding of chess than the previous.

## Pattern recognition ##
Masters know many more patterns, memory plays a key role, patterns also help remembering positions.

## Photographic memory chess is a myth. ##

Photographic memory doesn't exist.  Some people have excellent memories and other can develop their memory through association, imagery, linking, etc., but the idea of recalling something like a picture--the human brain doesn't work that way.  Master chessplayers were given a memory test:  they looked at a middle game positiion from a real game for a number of seconds.  Then they were asked to reproduce it on another board.  Most of them could do it easily.  Then they were presented with a board in which the pieces and pawns were mixed up in a random manner.  they could not recall more that the average person off the street.  So, a chessplayer doesn't really see a picture, he sees patterns of forces on the board, most of which he is familiar from millions of real games.  This is a weak doubled pawn, this is a fianchetto, this is a castled positiion, etc.

# Nimzowitsch My System Elements
Summary of the elements

### Center
The pawn is not a fighting unit by itself, because it doesn't threaten much when it crosses the border. It's attacking force is much lower than other pieces.  A pawnless advance can not be sustained because it will be repelled by the opponents pawn center.  Opposing free and mobile center pawn, is a dangerous criminal and must be executed *exchange by d5* or imprisoned *e4 by d6* 

**The center and it's urge to demobilize**  
- A free and mobile center is a terrible attacking power. it depends if the opponents kinghts can use tempi and find good posts.
- Protection of the center by pawns is preffered, a pawn feels at home defending, a piece feels restricted.  
- Take any center pawn if it can be done without too great danger.

### Development
In the development phase only moves are allowed that occupy or help occupy the center. This is only partially relevant in closed games because there is less direct contact and development completes at a slower pace.  
A pawn move must not be considered in itself a development move but a move which helps development  
No pawn grabbing before you complete development  

**Gaining tempi by:**
- Exchange
- Attack

### Objects of attack
We must render immobile as possible any object we are attacking. An immobile object of attack is the same as a sqaure to be captured, there is no difference because it is reduced to immobility.  
Dont allow objects of attack white Qd2 Bd3 black h6 is a bad move because white h3, g4, g5.

## Open files
A file is open when one's own pawn is not there or the own rook or queen is in front of the pawn, for example pawn on h2 with a rook on h3 the h file is open from h3 onward.  Enemy pawns or pieces don't matter to decide if a file is open or closed.  
By positioning your pieces centrally without allowing a pawn roller you provoke your opponent into exchanges which open files for you. For example a black Nd4 protected by c5, when captured by white Nf3xd4 after cxd4 opens the c-file for black.  

### Operations down a file 
The idea behind any operation on a file consists of finally penetrating on the 7th or 8th in the opponents position.
Access to the 7th and 8th 

- Direct exploitation of a file is reaching the 7th or 8th
- Indirect exploitation is like a springboard to attack reach or attack another file from the side  
- Evolutionary attack: concentrating on one point in order to build up superior forces to attack it  
- Revolutionary attack: forced breakthrough with sacrifices
- Both: First evolutionary, defending pieces are badly placed due to lack of space then revolutionary, a forcible breakthrough.  

## Undermining the block of granite a protected pawn on a file   
Thinning defenders by driving away, exchanges, cutting off  
By transfer of the attack from the protected to the unprotected defender, pawns or pieces

## Outpost
One of our pieces preferably a knight(best radius of attack) placed on a "outpost square", a square within enemy territory protected by pawn on a (half)open file (can still be attacked by a pawn in contrary to other definitions).  
 When the outpost is attacked by a pawn this weakens other squares/pawn's on the file. 

- Can be used as a base for new attacks
- Provokes a weakening on the file by the opponent
- The outpost square must be well protected

_the knight is a very special piece it can be attacked by all other pieces without it being able to capture the attacking piece and also the same applies to a piece that is attacked by a knight. But due to the short range a knight is often caught. When protected by a pawn a knight is more or less invinceable because all other pieces have a higher value, only a pawn could drive him away_

## Passed pawns
Definition: no opposing enemy pawns in front or on sides  
Can only be blocked by enemy pieces
- The best piece to blockade an enemy pawn is a pawn
- The most secure way to defend our pieces, a pawn

The candidate to create a passed pawn from a majority is the pawn with no opposing pawn. If you advance the other pawns, the candidate may become a backward pawn and will be harder to advance because of the weak square in front of it.  

Reasons to blockade a passed pawn with pieces
- Lust to expand cause the awakening of the men in the rear therefore the passed pawn must be kept under lock and key.
- Immunity of the blockading piece from attacks from the front
- Crippling effect of the blockade

Choice of blockading piece
- Elasticity
- Threats it can deliver

Elasticity of the blockading piece 
- Other pieces can look after the blockading square
- The blockading square is in the center
- The piece can return if the pawn advances further

To play against the blockader the same principles as with protected pawns as decribed in open files can be used, exchanging, driving away, attack with mulitple pieces and transfer of attack to the cramped defending pieces

_There is a lot of attention to passed pawns in the endgame in this chapter, you can play through the examples, also this is covered in step 5._

## Exchanging

Reasons to exchange
- To occupy or open a line without a loss of time
- To destroy a defender
- To not lose time retreating

## Pins  
Two kinds of Pins
- Partially pinned: can move along the line or diagonal of the pin.
- Completely pinned: cannot move at all, this is always the case with a knight

In a pin there are 3 actors
- The piece that is doing the pinning
- The piece that is pinned
- The piece behind the piece that is pinned, usually a powerful piece 

A pinned piece 
- Squares that are 'attacked' by the pinned piece are fair game
- Does not offer protection for other pieces
- Is a good target to attack because it is immobile and already attacked.

When a piece is pinned an attack by a pawn is decisive since flight is impossible, the piece creates the pressure by the pin and the pawn is the executioner. 

### Dealing with a pin on g5
- Challenging: Can cause weaknesses for example Bg5 on Nf3 chased away by h3 creates a target h3 which can be attacked by h4 g4-g5
- Ignoring: Can cause pawns to be broken up or doubled
- Unpinning: Placing a piece between 

## Discovered check
Discovered check closely relates to a pin, the difference is that the pinned piece is friendly instead of enemy, it becomes a discovered attack piece.  
**Pieces in a discovered attack**
- The threatening check piece
- The piece between 
- The threatened piece

The piece between resembles the little man who can do anything because he is protected by someone powerful, so all squares even those who are under heavy fire from your opponent are available to the piece which uncovers the check.  
Discovered check makes double attacks possible.

## Pawn Chain
A pawn chain are multiple pawns that are being blocked by pawns or pieces. The pawn chain is not about the number of links in the chain but if the oppenents pawns are restrained, it could also be achieved by pieces.
The bottom link in the chain which supports all the other links will be called the base. 

**Example**
**white d4, e5, f2, g2, h2 black d5, e6, f7, g7, h7**  
White base is d4, black base is e6, f7 is not part of the chain. 
The e5 pawn is advanced, demobilizes to form a wedge, removes f6 square from blacks knight and allows whites attacking forces to move more closely Qg4. The restricted kingside can also be attacked by Bd3 Nf3 and Bc1. After blacks f5 exf6 and white has an outpost on e5 and e6 is backward. A white pawn on f4 would have a negative effect blocking the bishops diagonal.  
As well as cramping the kingside e5 has the plan f2-f4-f5 and attack e6, the base of the chain.  
Possible results of this attack:
- Black surrenders the base of the chain by e6xf5, the pawn on e5 becomes mobile because it can move forward now the e6 pawn is gone.
- White builds a wedge by f6, cramps blacks position.
- White takes f5xe6, opens the f file, the blockaded object of attack e6 can be attacked with a flanking manouvre by the rook. 

1. Opposing base pawn fixed on it's square should be attacked by multiple pieces, the attacking pieces should be placed more agressively. 
2. Opponent will have difficulty developing, lesser elasticity and manouvrebility
3. Maintain pressue until you get a new weaknesses
4. Change the focus of attack to the new weaknesses

The goal in the endgame is a direct and real seizure of the object of attack, in the middlegame the goal is only help to create indirect advantages.

**Transfer of attack**
To change the base of the pawn chain to another for example when there a white c4, d5, e4, f3 vs black c7, d6, e5, f5. When e4 is very well guarded and after 0-0 black can by playing f4 transfer the base of the white chain from e4 to f3. f3 will be a weaker base because it is less guarded and the white king is close.

**Blocking a chain with pieces**
Nimzowitsch also gives an example where he gives up his own base of the chain d4 but replaces it with a piece and blocks black d5,e6 with pieces, this is possible because blacks c and f pawns are gone.

## Endgame
_Most endgame knowledge you can find in step 5 also, best is to play through the examples in the book_

# Nimzowitsch My System Positional Play
A typical widespread misconception is that every move must immidiately achieve something, an amateur looks for moves which threaten something or parry a threat. and neglects all other possible moves, such as waiting moves or moves to reposition his pieces. The question is which moves are intended to consolidate our position  and bring out own pieces in contact with squares that are strategically important to us ( stuggle against freeing moves and over protection ). When a positional player plays against a purely combinative player who is attacking violently is surprised by a move which brings it's own pieces in contact with a key square and this contact turns out to be miraculous with the result that the position is cleared up and the attack grinds to a halt. So don't always look for an attack, consolodating moves which meet the demands of the position are far more frequently what should be played. 

## Doubled pawns
- Compact double pawns has and adjacent pawn
- Isolated double pawns are Isolated

The white a2 c2 c3 d5 e4 vs black e5 d6 c7 b7 a7. Because of the doubled pawn the advance c4 c5 is easily blocked by b6. Black has the option to play c6 at anytime and force exchange on d5, the white complex is the strongest if the d pawn would still be on d4.

## Isolated queens pawns
An isolated queens pawn is the complex white a2, b2, d4, f2, g2, h2. black a7, b7, e6, f7, g7, h7. 

**Strengths in the middlegame**
- The outposts c5 and e5 outpost for white outweigh d5 for black
- The ability to 'expand' d4 d5
- Diagonals for white d3-h7 and g5-f6 put kingside pressure (after 0-0).

**Weakness in the endgame**
- It can't be defended by other pawns. 
- Weak squares around the pawn.

Recommended a solid setup for white, strong support of d4: Be3 Qc2 Rc1 Rd1. Attack only when the opportunity presents itself. 

White plans: 
- Aim for d4-d5 exd5 abd recapture with a piece, gives white a more centralized position
- Play on the c-file

Black plans 
- Play for endgame
- Nd5xNc3 b2xc3 to fix c3 and lay siege to it. ( gives white 'the isolated pawn pair' )
- Attack on the d pawn and transfer of attack to the queen side

## Isolated pawn pair
White a2, c3, d4 after black Nd5xNc3 b2xc3 in an isolated queen pawn position.  
- White: Advance c3 to c4. Then it is no longer the passive isolated pawn pair but called 'hanging pawns' which is more threatening. 
- Black: Completely block c3 and d4, white must defend c3 and d4 and has lack of space

## Hanging pawns
The hanging pawns c4 d4 share some characteristcs with isolated pawn
Pros:
- Outposts on c5 and e5
- The hanging pawns threaten c4-c5 and d4-d5

Cons:
- Have to be defended by pieces
- Weak squares around them

## Bishops

Strengths
- Range 
- Can control multiple opposing passed pawns in an endgame

Weaknesses
- Cannot control space of the opposite color

### According to my trainer
- Assymetric position favors bishop because of possible passed pawn creation.
- Pawns on both wings favor bishops
- Smyslov rule, knight is stronger than bishop in position with fixed pawns.

## Bishop pair advantages
- Strong in a kingside attack, one bishop forces a pawn to move and the other can attack the king on the freed diagonal
- Advance of a pawn mass supported by bishops cramps the opponents position because the opponents pawns can not oppose it.
- Cramping kinghts

## Overprotection
Overprotection is the protection by pieces of a strategically important point to prevent the undermining of it. 
For example white a2, b2, d4, e5, f2, g2, h2 black a7, b7, d5, e6, f7, g7, h7. The pawn d4 could be overprotected.  

Stragecially strong points to over protect.
- The base of a pawn chain 
- A central squares
- An outpost

## Manoevering
A pivot is a valauable square where different pieces can places to attack different points in a position the relation between square and the pieces is that the pieces are in contact with the square, the result of overprotecting.  
Manoevering is possible when there is  
- A presence of a pivot 
- Multiple threats can be directed to a pawn weakness
- Multiple pawn weaknesses

Manoevers:  
- By pivoting pieces on a strategically valuable square. 
- Between attacking a pawn weakness from the file and from the 7th rank ( with R or Q ) ( via checks on the king )
- Between two pawn weaknesses.

## Karpov rule 
- Look for multifunctional moves.
- No pieces in each others way.

# Time management
Nimzowitsch on use of time: The game of chess is a struggle not a mathematical excersize.
Don't always try to find the best move, try to win, dont waste 15 mins time looking for a forced mate in a +3 position. Improve the position instead.

## Saving time by study
- Know your openings in advance.
- Study typical middlegames arising from your opening so you know the plans

## Process of deciding on a move
- During opponents move, look for weakness, ideas, be creative not too much concrete calculation, but look at potential tactical possibilities. Figure out what white and black want.
- If you're opponents move is more or less forced 90% chance it will be played, you can already think like the the move has been played and decide on your own move, this will give you an edge on the clock.
- After opponents move, ask 2 questions what does it threaten, how does it change the position?
- Make inventory of moves to look at first, do a quick scan for forced moves you can play, look for positional moves.
- Gain understanding by not too deeply calculating some lines.
- Is one move clearly the best or are there multiple options? mayby other moves became interesting, during the calculation?
- Have a preference for good but low risk moves, positional moves are quicker and more reliable.
- If you want to go for a sharp line look for safety nets. ( an alternative
line which you can adopt if, half-way through your intended continuation, you discover that it doesn't work. e.g. perpetual check)
- Don't waste too much time looking over alternatives once you're convinced you found a good move.
- Only at the point you have decided you want to play the move, be precise in calculating your opponents possible reply's, are the forced moves, are there sacrifices? If you run into complications, you want to go back and look at other moves. 

## Lazyness vs wasting time
Laziness at the chessboard manifests itself in two ways. The first is when you have a complicated possibility, but decide not to analyse it on the
grounds that it would be too much work. Note that is not the same as the
'Do not analyse unnecesary tactics':'DAUT' that represents a conscious weighing of the balance between the timespent and the possibility of finding a better move.

## Critical moments
You can spend extra time in a critical position where you feel there is a clear difference between the best move and the second best move, half a point or more. These are often sharp tactical positions.

- Forcing move(s) exist which might lead to a decisive advantage
- Deciding whether or not to release pawn tension
- Deciding whether or not to allow trades of certain pieces
- When the opponent has a clear threat that needs to be dealt with in some way
- When a move in question is very committal and transforms the position in some way that can't be undone

# Nuanced value of the pieces
- A pawn 1
- A pawn is worth 3 development moves during opening and early middelgame.
- 3.45 knight
- 3.55 bishop
- 5.25 rook ( is worth a little less in the beginning because there are still many pieces, little mobility )
- 10 queen
- 4 king
- 0.5 bishop pair, the reason it is strong because 1 bishop has no opponent, pressure colors of complex of your unopposed bishop.
- Bishops suffer from center pawns
- Knights benefit from a closed position and outposts
- Rook pawn have slightly less value due to the influence on the center protecting of squares, ar ook pawn only attacks one square.
- Queen and knight is a better combination for an attack than queen and bishop for a kingside attack
- Rook is more valueable when you have one because the other rook does not get in the way
- Depending on the position strong advanced passed pawns can be worth 2 or even 3 on the 7th, so passed pawns must be pushed!

# Before a game
Take a relaxing day before, no intensive excersize or chess study.  
Eat 2 hours before the game and take a nap.
Do some tactics slightly above your level just before the game, to activate your brain.
